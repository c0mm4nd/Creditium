# Problem Overview

- Unsecured loans are a high-risk lending option for financial institutions, as they lack collateral to secure the loan.
- Traditional credit scoring models may not accurately assess the risk of default for unsecured loans, leading to higher interest rates or loan denials for borrowers.
- Decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platforms offer an alternative to traditional lending, but they face similar challenges in assessing risk for unsecured loans.
- According to a report by DeFi Pulse, the total value locked in DeFi protocols reached over $40 billion in February 2021, highlighting the growing importance of this sector.
- To address these challenges, this workshop proposes a privacy-preserving solution that leverages federated learning to train risk assessment models using both off-chain and on-chain data sources.

Sure, here's an example markdown slide that introduces federated learning and explains how it can be used to train risk assessment models using both off-chain and on-chain data sources:

# Federated Learning for Risk Assessment

- Federated learning is a machine learning technique that allows multiple parties to collaboratively train a model without sharing their raw data.
- In the context of risk assessment for unsecured loans, federated learning can be used to train models using both off-chain and on-chain data sources.
- Off-chain data sources may include credit reports, income statements, and other financial information provided by borrowers.
- On-chain data sources may include transaction histories and other publicly available information stored on the blockchain.
- By combining these data sources through federated learning, lenders can develop more accurate risk assessment models while preserving the privacy of individual borrowers.
- This approach also allows lenders to evaluate borrowers who may not have a traditional credit history or collateral to secure the loan.

Sure, here's an example markdown slide that describes the proposed solution in detail:

# Proposed Solution: Privacy-Preserving Unsecured Loan Risk Assessment

- Our proposed solution is a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform equipped with a privacy-preserving, unsecured loan risk assessment system.
- This system leverages federated learning to train risk assessment models using both off-chain and on-chain data sources, while preserving the privacy of individual borrowers.
- The platform is built on the Ethereum blockchain and uses smart contracts to automate loan origination, repayment, and risk assessment.
- Borrowers can apply for unsecured loans through the platform by providing basic information such as their name, address, and income level.
- Lenders can then use federated learning to train a risk assessment model using this information as well as other off-chain data sources such as credit reports.
- The model is trained collaboratively across multiple parties without sharing raw data or compromising individual privacy.
- Once the model is trained, lenders can use it to evaluate borrower default risk for unsecured loans while preserving privacy.

- If a loan is approved, smart contracts are used to automate loan origination and repayment based on predefined terms and conditions.

Sure, here's an example markdown slide that discusses potential benefits and drawbacks of implementing this solution on a server-side environment with program-level isolation and a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE):

# Benefits and Drawbacks of Server-Side Implementation with TEE

## Benefits

- A server-side implementation with program-level isolation and a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) provides a high level of security for the risk assessment system.
- TEEs are designed to protect sensitive data and code from unauthorized access or modification, making them ideal for applications that require strong security guarantees.
- Program-level isolation ensures that the risk assessment system is isolated from other programs running on the server, reducing the risk of interference or tampering.
- This approach also allows for efficient processing of large amounts of data, which is necessary for training machine learning models using federated learning.

## Drawbacks

- Implementing this solution on a server-side environment with program-level isolation and a TEE may require significant resources and expertise.
- TEEs are not widely available or standardized, which may limit the scalability of this approach.
- There may be additional costs associated with maintaining and securing the server infrastructure required to support this solution.
- This approach may also limit user control over their own data, as all data processing would occur on the server rather than on individual devices.

Sure, here's an example markdown slide that provides examples or case studies that illustrate how this solution could be applied in real-world scenarios:

# Real-World Applications of Privacy-Preserving Unsecured Loan Risk Assessment

## Example 1: Microfinance in Developing Countries

- In many developing countries, access to credit is limited for individuals and small businesses without collateral or a traditional credit history.
- Our proposed solution could be used to develop risk assessment models that incorporate alternative data sources such as mobile phone usage or social media activity.
- By using federated learning to train these models while preserving privacy, lenders could evaluate borrowers who would otherwise be excluded from the traditional lending market.

## Example 2: Peer-to-Peer Lending Platforms

- Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms allow individual investors to lend money directly to borrowers without the need for a traditional financial institution.
- Our proposed solution could be integrated into P2P lending platforms to provide a more accurate and secure risk assessment system.
- By using federated learning to train models using both off-chain and on-chain data sources, lenders could evaluate borrower default risk while preserving privacy and reducing the risk of fraud.

## Example 3: Small Business Loans

- Small businesses often struggle to obtain loans from traditional financial institutions due to their size or lack of collateral.
- Our proposed solution could be used by alternative lenders such as online lenders or crowdfunding platforms to develop more accurate risk assessment models for small business loans.
- By using federated learning to train these models while preserving privacy, lenders could evaluate borrower default risk more accurately and provide loans to businesses that would otherwise be excluded from the traditional lending market.
